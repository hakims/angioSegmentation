# Dr-SAM Implementation Analysis Summary

## Core Project Principles

### Code Reuse and Utility Management
- **Always Check Existing Utilities First**:
  - Before writing new code, check the `utils` directory for existing functionality
  - Common utilities are organized by purpose:
    - `io.py`: File operations, media handling, frame extraction
    - `vis.py`: Visualization and image processing
    - `coco_utils.py`: COCO format operations
    - `schema_utils.py`: Schema validation and metadata handling

- **Avoid Code Duplication**:
  - Never duplicate functionality that exists in utilities
  - If similar code appears in multiple places, create a new utility function
  - Keep utility functions focused and well-documented

- **Utility Creation Guidelines**:
  - Create new utility functions when a pattern emerges across multiple files
  - Place utilities in the most appropriate existing file, or create a new one if needed
  - Document the purpose and usage of each utility function
  - Include example usage in docstrings

- **Code Organization**:
  - Main pipeline code should focus on orchestration and flow
  - Implementation details should be in utility functions
  - Keep files focused on a single responsibility
  - Use clear, descriptive names for both files and functions

## Issues Identified and Resolved

1. **Filter Application Issue**:
   - Original DrSAM applies ModeFilter twice
   - Our implementation was only applying it once
   - **FIXED**: Updated to apply filter twice

2. **Point Generation Logic**:
   - Original DrSAM uses specific point pairing for exactly 3 boxes: `[[0,3], [1,4], [2,5]]`
   - Our implementation used a more flexible approach
   - **FIXED**: Implemented hybrid approach - original logic for 3 boxes, flexible for others

3. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Original DrSAM had specific refinement logic for 3 boxes
   - **FIXED**: Added special handling for the 3-box case vs. other cases

4. **Testing Framework Issues**:
   - Original testing code had redundancy and circular dependencies
   - **FIXED**: Developed modular validator utilities and refactored test scripts

5. **Pipeline Organization**:
   - Main pipeline had duplicated code paths for testing vs. regular mode
   - Box generation logic was scattered and inefficient
   - **FIXED**: Refactored to unified pipeline with consistent box handling

6. **Terminology Inconsistency**:
   - Inconsistent naming for bounding boxes (`box`, `boxes`, `bboxes`, etc.)
   - **FIXED**: Standardized on `boundingBox` terminology across the codebase

7. **Testing Framework Structure**:
   - Legacy testing files with duplicated functionality
   - **FIXED**: Reorganized testing framework with `originalDrSAM` module and cleaner imports

8. **Metadata Format Incompatibility**:
   - Original Dr-SAM metadata format differs from our expected format
   - **IN PROGRESS**: Planning conversion to COCO format as a standard

9. **Other Potential Issues**:
   - Auto-generated bounding boxes may select non-vessel areas
   - SAM model handling could be improved with better fallbacks
   - Need better visualization for debugging

## Implemented Solutions

1. **Double ModeFilter Application**:
   ```python
   # Changed from
   fixed_mask = np.asarray(im_pil)
   # To
   fixed_mask = np.asarray(im_pil.filter(ImageFilter.ModeFilter(size=7)))
   ```

2. **Hybrid Point Pairing Approach**:
   ```python
   # Use original DrSAM point pairing when exactly 3 boxes
   if num_boxes == 3 and len(input_points) >= 6:
       input_points_v2 = [[input_points[i], input_points[i + 3]] for i in range(3)]
   else:
       # More flexible approach for different numbers of boxes
       for i_box in range(num_boxes):
           pts = []
           if i_box < len(input_points):
               pts.append(input_points[i_box])
           if (i_box + num_boxes) < len(input_points):
               pts.append(input_points[i_box + num_boxes])
           input_points_v2.append(pts)
   ```

3. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Added detailed point logging
   - Added information about point pairing
   - Better error messages for segmentation failures

4. **Modular Testing Framework**:
   - Created base `SegmentationValidator` class with common metrics and visualization utilities
   - Implemented specialized `DrSAMValidator` for original Dr-SAM dataset validation
   - Added `dr_sam_runner.py` with pipeline execution utilities

5. **Unified Pipeline Architecture**:
   - Simplified main pipeline with a single code path
   - Created consistent box handling with clear priority: command-line boxes → local boxes.json → auto-generation
   - Improved direct image handling and output directory clarity

## Recent Improvements (Latest Refactoring)

1. **Simplified Pipeline Structure**:
   - Removed unnecessary abstraction layers (`discover_files` and `process_folder` functions)
   - Integrated functionality directly into the main pipeline
   - Made testing mode a configuration option rather than a separate code path

2. **Enhanced Box Priority System**:
   - Created clear hierarchy: custom boxes → local boxes.json → auto-generation
   - Added automatic loading of expert boxes for testing mode
   - Improved error handling and feedback for box sources

3. **Better Input Handling**:
   - Added fallback for direct image files when no structured folders found
   - Improved path handling between input and output directories
   - Clearer feedback about file discovery and processing

4. **Consolidated Video Processing**:
   - Centralized video cropping and frame extraction in one place
   - Collected all frames before running segmentation for efficiency
   - Leveraged utility functions while keeping logic flow in the main pipeline

5. **Improved Documentation**:
   - Updated README with comprehensive usage instructions
   - Added clear explanations of bounding box priority
   - Created better docstrings and comments throughout the code

6. **Testing Framework Reorganization**:
   - Created dedicated `tests/originalDrSAM` directory for original Dr-SAM testing code
   - Renamed utilities for clarity (`testing_utils.py` → `drsam_testing_utils.py`)
   - Cleaned up imports and removed redundant test files
   - Added proper package structure with `__init__.py` files

7. **Standardized Terminology**:
   - Replaced all instances of "box" with "boundingBox" for consistency
   - Updated parameter names, variable names, and comments for clarity
   - Ensured consistent naming in files and function calls

## Metadata Format Standardization Plan

After analyzing how the original Dr-SAM handles metadata and our current approach, we identified a format mismatch that affects compatibility:

1. **Current Format Differences**:
   - Original Dr-SAM: Array of objects with `image_id` and `bboxes` fields
   - Our Pipeline: Dictionary mapping filenames to bounding boxes

2. **COCO Format Adoption Plan**:
   - Adopt industry-standard COCO JSON format for annotations
   - Create utility functions for loading/saving COCO data
   - Implement conversion from original Dr-SAM format to COCO
   - Update pipeline components to work with COCO annotations

3. **Implementation Phases**:
   - Phase 1: COCO utilities and schema definition
   - Phase 2: Original Dr-SAM metadata conversion
   - Phase 3: Main pipeline updates for COCO support 
   - Phase 4: Documentation and examples for annotation workflows

## Outstanding Work

   - Consider adding heuristics for specific vessel regions

3. **Comprehensive Validation**:
   - Need to run full validation on the complete Dr-SAM dataset

- Fixed pytest collection errors caused by test classes with __init__ methods
- Resolved marker registration with proper pytest.ini configuration
- Simplified test logic to avoid unnecessary conversions

## Using the Test Framework
Running tests is now done using standard pytest commands:
```
pytest                 # Run all tests
pytest -m single_frame # Run only single frame tests
pytest -v              # Run with verbose output
```

## Additional Notes
The commented-out pipeline tests should be implemented when ready, but for now they serve as documentation of intended functionality. These tests will validate the end-to-end pipeline process including vessel segmentation and stenosis calculation.
